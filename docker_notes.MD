1. Move mail_rulez_maint.py into setup - have the whole thing run from setup.
2. First release will assume the following (basically meaning this is just for Jay's implementation)
   1. All required folders are already set up on the server
   2. The rules that have already been set up are the ones we're going with.
## TODO
   * Way to customize rules post implementation.  Maybe a wizard?
   * Web interface?
   * Allow user to review/approve folder creation
   * Check that required folders exist on server
   *
